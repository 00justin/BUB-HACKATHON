# Problem
Community Spaces are generally highly relied upon the neighborhood/city, but sometimes, they are often not taken care of and people don't go out of there way to improve these community spaces. Even if they try to, poor decision are made by the local government which leads to unhappy results. 

# Solution
Using blockchain technology, implementing a "Neighborhood Token DAO", into the neighborhood/city can heavily influence the community into taking more care of resources. Use of this token mainly includes systems where citizens are able to Vote on funding decisions using token ownerships and they can pay their tokens for community resources (i.e 4 hrs of using the community rental lawnmower)

# insight
Residents of a certain community/neighborhood/city recieve a token that represents a stake of the community resources. Use of blockchain allows have a strong voice in decisions which can take away the issue of fraud and unwanted results because of the transparent records of each individual's token
